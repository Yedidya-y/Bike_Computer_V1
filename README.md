An IoT-based bike computer using ESP32, BLE sensors, and GPS/GPX analysis to provide real-time shifting recommendations.

Core Features
* Real-time speed and cadence tracking via BLE sensors.
* Predictive gear shift recommendations based on GPX route analysis (upcoming slope).
* Real-time slope calculation using GPS altitude data.
* Built-in Wi-Fi web server for uploading new GPX files.
* (Future Goal) Drivetrain wear analysis based on sensor data.
